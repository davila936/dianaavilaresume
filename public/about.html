<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am riginally from Honduras. At the age of 4, I moved to the U.S. with my
  family. I have lived in Indianapolis ever since, but it has not been easy.
  Being an immigrant and DACA recipient, Diana has held a passion for paving the
  way for other immigrants. Through my focus in helping immigrants, I wanted to
  try something new. In high school, I was doing a lot of marketing and video
  editting. So my last year of college, I decided to take a class in Media
  Production.

  This helped me open up the interest of editting all over again. Once in this
  field, I started to discover other areas I was interested in, one of them
  being website design. This then brought me to redesign the website for a
  family owned business so I could see if this is something that I really wanted
  to do. Designing that website triggered a love for website design. I then
  started taking a coding class to learn about coding. I feel that I can express
  lots of creativity through website design and the options are endless. In my
  free time, I enjoy traveling, spending time with family, learning new things
  every day, and crafting.
